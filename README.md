# ASCII-Code-Reveler-1.0
**ASCII Code Reveler** is a small portable **Batch program** that lets you know the **ASCII code** of the pressed key from the keyboard (Instead of writing the ‘Letter directly ‘ on the screen). All you need to do is **press a key** on the keyboard, and the program will **reveal** the corresponding **ASCII Code** on the **Title Bar** of the **command line window**.

# ASCII CODE REVELER VER.1.0 | BY KVC

You’ll need to know the **ASCII Code** when you are building some kind of awesome batch program so as to check which key is pressed on the console. Thereafter we can use a conditional **‘if’ statement** to compare the input with some static values of the key presses, those static values can be gotten using **ASCII Code Reveler** by KVC.

In this Project, I use **‘mChoice.exe’** to get ASCII code of pressed Key [ mchoice.exe is ‘modified choice.exe command by kvc’ ]
