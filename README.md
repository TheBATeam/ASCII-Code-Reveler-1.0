# ASCII-Code-Reveler-1.0
ASCII Code Reveler is A small portable Batch program that lets you know the ASCII code of the pressed key from the keyboard (Instead of writing the ‘Letter directly ‘ on the screen). All you need to do is press a key on the keyboard, and the program will reveal the corresponding ASCII Code on the Title Bar of the command line window.
